Our third and final project is the final installation of the Bunker Bundle. The Disaster Dashboard encompasses a full-stack development project utilizing the MERN Stack. The Disaster Dashboard allows you to see current disasters, near earth events, current COVID-19 Statistics, the current price of Gold and Silver, and a checklist that allows you to verify you have the items needed to survive a disaster. Finally, to help decompress after seeing all of this information, the user can look at puppy gifs to help relax. 

We utilized multiple APIS including [EONET-NASA](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v3/) (Disasters), [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/resource/) (Covid),  [NEO-NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/neo/) (Near Earth Objects), [GOLDAPI](https://www.goldapi.io/api/) (Gold & Silver), [PUPPIES](https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/) (Puppies), to help provide updated data to concerned citizens about critical information on and near Earth.
